# SpedenSpelit2.0
My first "REAL" Arduino UNO project. Classic Finnish TV-show realated game, with added features.

So, for this project I used Arduino UNO, LCD-screen, five NO-buttons, 5 leds, breadboard, bunch of jumper cables and resistors!
If you are not familiar with Finnish TV-shows in 90's, you probably should look this up on YouTube.

Basically what i did is created the "Nopeuspeli" from "Speden Spelit", but I used 5 buttons instead of 4 as in the show. But i didn't want to stop there, so i also added another game, "Muistipeli", which is more widely known as Simon Says.

I hope you find this useful and/or fun!
